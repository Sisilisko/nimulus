# Project-Nimulus, fast and beginner-friendly way to get into the rabbithole of computers

# SUPER IMPORTANT: This is very much work in progress! I just started this project 26th of October, 2024.

## The goal of this project, tämän projektin tavoite, der Ziel dieses Projekt:
(there might be error(s) in that german sentence, I am still learning... :D)

This project has TWO main goals:
- Make learning about computers easier and try to encourage people to experiment with technology. \
- Trying to make everyone recognize Nim as valid option for lower level development, because this language REALLY has potential for it.

## Why I chose Nim for this project?

"Choosing Nim over C is like choosing prebuilt summer cottage instead of Hectare of land and an rusted axe." -Sisilisko (me)


In my opinion Nim has the same capabilities like C or C++ and you can make almost anything with these languages. \
What I have seen is that Nim gives a great starting point for variety of projects. You don't have to develop everything from scratch like in C. You can develop everything from scratch if you just want but you don't need to.
Nim's metaprogramming is also very good thing for extending the language for your own needs. I am planning to utilize those features as much as I can.

And maybe the most important reason, why I chose Nim for this project: I am quite a beginner when it comes to programming and Nim is just so easy to write with.

Damn... This is way too underrated language.
